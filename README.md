## Features

### Quick scaffolding
Create components, containers, routes, selectors and sagas - and their tests - right from the CLI!
### Instant feedback
Enjoy the best DX (Developer eXperience) and code your app at the speed of thought! Your saved changes to the CSS and JS are reflected instantaneously without refreshing the page. Preserve application state even when you update something in the underlying code!
### Predictable state management
Unidirectional data flow allows for change logging and time travel debugging.
### Next generation JavaScript
Use template strings, object destructuring, arrow functions, JSX syntax and more, today.
### Next generation CSS
Write composable CSS that's co-located with your components for complete modularity. Unique generated class names keep the specificity low while eliminating style clashes. Ship only the styles that are on the page for the best performance.
### Industry-standard routing
It's natural to want to add pages (e.g. `/about`) to your application, and routing makes this possible.
### Industry-standard i18n internationalization support
Scalable apps need to support multiple languages, easily add and support multiple languages with `react-intl`.
### Offline-first
The next frontier in performant web apps: availability without a network connection from the instant your users load the app.
### SEO
We support SEO (document head tags management) for search engines that support indexing of JavaScript content. (eg. Google)

But wait... there's more!
